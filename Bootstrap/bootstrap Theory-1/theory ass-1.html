1). What is Bootstrap, and why is it useful for website design?

   Bootstrap is a popular open-source CSS framework used to create responsive and mobile-first websites.
It includes pre-built CSS classes, JavaScript components, and a powerful grid system that make web design faster and easier.

-> Why it is useful:

     Helps create fully responsive layouts quickly
     Provides ready-made UI components (buttons, cards, forms, navbars, etc.)
     Saves development time by removing the need to write CSS from scratch
     Ensures consistent design across all pages
     Mobile-first structure improves user experience on all devices.


2). Explain the Bootstrap grid system and how it helps create responsive layouts.

The Bootstrap grid system uses 12 columns which can be divided into different widths depending on screen size.
It is based on rows and columns using classes like:

    col- (extra small devices)
    col-sm- (small devices)
    col-md- (medium devices)
    col-lg- (large devices)
    col-xl- (extra large devices)

 -> How it helps:

    Automatically adjusts content for different screen sizes
    Allows developers to hide, rearrange, or resize content
    Provides responsive spacing and alignment
    Eliminates the need for writing complex media queries

 Example:
    col-md-6 means the column takes 6/12 width on medium screens and full width on smaller screens.


3). List and explain at least three Bootstrap components.

Navbar-
   A responsive navigation bar that supports brand logos, menus, dropdowns, togglers, and collapsible links.

Cards-
   A flexible content container used for images, text, buttons, and descriptions — commonly used for portfolios, product listings, etc.

Buttons-
   Styled buttons with predefined classes such as btn-primary, btn-success, btn-danger, etc.
   They maintain consistent size, color, and responsiveness.  -->
