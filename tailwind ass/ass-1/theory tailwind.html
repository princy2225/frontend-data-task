<!-- Tailwind Theory :
 
 Q-1. explain what tailwind css is and how it differs from traditional css framework
 A: What is Tailwind CSS?
    
    Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes, allowing developers to design custom interfaces directly in HTML, unlike traditional frameworks that offer pre-built components and predefined UI styles.

    Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides small, single-purpose classes such as:

   * text-center
   * bg-blue-500
   * p-4
   * mb-2
   * justify-center
   * flex
   * items-center
   * rounded-xl  
    These classes let you design your UI directly inside your HTML without writing separate CSS files.
    
    ✔ Tailwind is not a component-based framework

     Unlike Bootstrap or Material UI, Tailwind does not come with pre-designed components like:

   * Buttons
   * Navbars
   * Cards
   * Modals
    Instead, you create your own designs using Tailwind’s utility classes.
     
    Example:  <div class="bg-red-200 text-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg"> Hello Tailwind!    </div>

| Feature                     | Tailwind CSS        | Traditional CSS Framework (Bootstrap) |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Design Style                | Utility-first       | Component-based                       |
| Customization               | Very high           | Limited                               |
| Pre-made Components         | ❌ No                | ✔ Yes                                 |
| File Size                   | Small (after purge) | Larger                                |
| Speed of Creating Custom UI | Fast                | Slow (need overrides)                 |
| Code Writing                | Mostly in HTML      | HTML + CSS                            |
| Looks                       | Unique              | Similar across websites               |

 Q-2. describe the concept of utility-first css and its advantages:
   ✅ What is Utility-First CSS?

    Utility-first CSS is a design approach where you use small, single-purpose classes directly in HTML to style elements.
    Each utility class performs one job only, such as:

   * p-4 → padding
   * text-center → center text
   * bg-blue-300 → background color
   * flex → display flex
   * rounded-lg → border radius
   * m-3 → margin
   
   Advantages of Utility-First CSS
1️⃣ Faster Development
   You can style everything directly inside HTML, so you don’t need to switch between HTML and CSS files.

2️⃣ No Need to Write Custom CSS
   Most designs can be created using pre-built utility classes.
   This reduces custom CSS and makes the project cleaner.

3️⃣ Highly Consistent Design
   Since utility classes follow a fixed scale (font size, spacing, colors), your whole website becomes more consistent.

4️⃣ Easy to Maintain
   There are no long CSS files with repeated selectors.
   HTML shows exact styling of each element.

5️⃣ No CSS Conflicts
   No issues like:
   overriding CSS
   duplicate classes
   naming problems
   Becomes easier in large projects or team projects.

6️⃣ Smaller CSS File Size (Performance)
   Unused utility classes are removed in production using PurgeCSS, making the final CSS very small.

7️⃣ More Control & Flexibility
   You design exactly how you want, not limited to a framework’s default style.-->

   Q-3. list and explain at least five common tailwind classes :
   
   1. Flex :
    <div class="flex">
  <p>Item 1</p>
  <p>Item 2</p>
</div>

   2. Text Center :
    <h1 class="text-center">Centered Heading</h1>

    3. Padding :
    <div class="p-4 bg-gray-200">Content with Padding</div>

    4. Margin Bottom :
    <div class="mb-6">Content with Bottom Margin</div>
