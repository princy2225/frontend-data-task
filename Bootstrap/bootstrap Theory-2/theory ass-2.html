<!--  Assignment 2 : Advanced Bootstrap Components

{ Theory Assignment }

1). Explain how modals and carousels work in Bootstrap.
Modals

A modal is a pop-up dialog box used to show messages, forms, or confirmations.

Bootstrap controls modals using:
HTML structure (modal, modal-dialog, modal-content)

JavaScript activation using data attributes
Example: data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#myModal"

Carousels

A carousel is a slideshow component used for displaying images or text.
It uses:

carousel, carousel-item, carousel-inner classes
Controls (next/prev) & indicators
Auto-slide with built-in JavaScript



2). Describe the purpose of utility classes in Bootstrap and give examples.

Utility classes are small, single-purpose CSS helper classes that provide quick styling without writing custom CSS.

Examples:

Spacing → mt-3, p-4, ms-2
Text → text-center, text-danger
Display → d-flex, d-none
Colors → bg-primary, text-light

They speed up development by allowing quick styling adjustments.



3). Discuss the importance of customizing Bootstrap variables for unique styling.

Bootstrap uses Sass variables for colors, spacing, fonts, border radius, etc.

Customizing these variables allows:

Unique branding (custom primary/secondary colors)
Adjusting spacing & typography
Creating a personalized look while keeping Bootstrap structure
Avoiding repetitive custom CSS
Designers can override variables or create a custom Bootstrap build. -->
