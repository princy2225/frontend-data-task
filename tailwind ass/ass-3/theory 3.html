<!-- Que-1 Purpose of Flexbox & Its Benefits for Responsive Design
 
    A: Purpose of Flexbox

    Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a one-dimensional layout system in CSS used to arrange items horizontally or vertically.
    Its main goal is to make it easier to create flexible, responsive, and well-aligned layouts without using floats, tables, or manual calculations.

  * Benefits for Responsive Design

    ✔ Automatic space adjustment
    Flexbox adjusts items based on screen size—no need for complex media queries.

    ✔ Easy horizontal & vertical alignment
    Centering or spacing elements becomes very simple (e.g., justify-center, items-center in Tailwind).

    ✔ Reordering elements without changing HTML
    With order, you can rearrange items for different screen sizes.

    ✔ Flexible item sizing
    tems can shrink, grow, and wrap automatically based on available space.

    ✔ Great for navigation bars, forms, cards, layouts
    It's designed to handle common responsive UI patterns.-->

<!-- Que-2 Main Flexbox Properties :

    (These apply to the flex container) 
    
           A) flex-direction
       Controls direction of items along the main axis.

       Values:

       row (default) → left to right
       row-reverse → right to left
       column → top to bottom
       column-reverse → bottom to top
       ➡️ Decides whether items line up horizontally or vertically.
       
          B) justify-content
       Controls alignment of items on the main axis (horizontal if row, vertical if column).

       Common values:

       flex-start → items start of the main axis
       center → items centered
       flex-end → items at end
       space-between → equal gaps between items
       space-around → equal space around items
       space-evenly → equal spacing everywhere
       ➡️ Used for spacing items like navbar links.
       
       C) align-items
      Controls alignment on the cross axis (vertical if row, horizontal if column).

       Common values:

       flex-start
       center
       flex-end
       stretch (default, items stretch to container height)
       ➡️ Used for vertical alignment inside a row.-->       

<!-- Que-3 Difference Between flex-grow, flex-shrink & flex-basis

     (These apply to the flex items, not the container.)
     
     A) flex-grow
      Controls how much an item expands to fill available extra space.

      Example:

      flex-grow: 1;
      → Item grows and takes available free space.
      0 = no growth (default)
      
      B) flex-shrink
      Controls how much an item shrinks when space is small.

      Example:

      flex-shrink: 1;
      → Item shrinks when the container is too small.
      0 = item will NOT shrink.

      C) flex-basis
      Defines the initial size of the item before grow/shrink is applied.

      Examples:
      flex-basis: 200px;
      flex-basis: 30%;
      Acts similar to setting a width, but more flexible in flexbox.

      In Simple Words:
      Property	             Meaning	                     When it works
      flex-grow         How much item grows	              When space is extra
      flex-shrink	    How much item shrinks	          When space is less
      flex-basis	    Default starting size	            Always
      Quick Example

      If items have:

      .item1 { flex: 1; }
      .item2 { flex: 2; }

      flex-grow distributes extra space → item2 is twice item1
      flex-shrink applies when screen shrinks
      flex-basis defaults to 0 unless specified-->
